# HOME-AUTOMATION
Homes can be interfaced with
sensors including motion sensors, light sensors and
temperature sensors and provide automated toggling of
devices based on conditions. More energy can be conserved
by ensuring occupation of the house before turning on devices
and checking brightness and turning off lights if not
necessary. The system can be integrated closely with home
security solutions to allow greater control and safety for home
owners. The next step would be to extend this system to
automate a large scale environment, such as offices and
factories. Home Automation offers a global standard for
interoperable products. Standardization enables smart homes
that can control appliances, lighting, environment, energy
management and security as well as the expandability to
connect with other networks
